#eznn

Easy (ez) neural network (nn). Intended to be a quick tool to see if neural 
networks are right for you, by allowing you to easily try it on your dataset.  

## Introduction

This is a modified, hopefully easier-to-use version of the Python code that 
can be found on:  
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src  

Each feature vector can be stored as a single file.

## Usage

The user-friendliness of the program is still being improved. Will be ready 
soon!

## Input Representation

The first row is the space-delimited input vector.
The second row is the space-delimited output vector.
All values must be in [0, 1].
